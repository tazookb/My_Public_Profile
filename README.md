# My_Public_Profile
A bried overview of projects (all done using Open Source Data) 

Hello,
Thanks for visiting my Public Portfolio. It is currently under development and not finished yet. I have only included some projects that I have done using public data. 
All projects completed not using publicly availiable data are not on this repository.

The first python project displayed is a recreational project to do word sentiment analysis of former US President Donald Trump's tweets. This projects demonstrates skills in Python specifically in data cleaning, and data visualization.
